        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Eclipsed Truth Rattles in the Cup</strong> is a digital adaptation of the classic liar’s dice game, designed and developed from scratch in Unreal Engine. 
          Inspired by <em>Tian Guan Ci Fu</em> (known in English as <em>Heaven’s Official Blessing</em>), the project blends bluffing mechanics with character‑driven dialogue to bring familiar personalities to life. 
          Each player begins with five dice, hidden from their opponent. Players bid on the total dice count between both cups, bluffing or challenging as the tension rises. 
          If a bluff is exposed, the liar loses a die. The match continues until one player runs out of dice — a deceptively simple premise that becomes a battle of wit, risk, and trust.

        <h2>Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          The rules are faithful to liar’s dice tradition:
          <ul>
            <li>Each player rolls five dice, visible only to themselves.</li>
            <li>Players bid on the combined total across both sets of dice.</li>
            <li>Bids can be raised, bluffed, or challenged.</li>
            <li>If a bluff is caught, the liar loses a die.</li>
            <li>The game ends when one player has no dice left.</li>
          </ul>
          This structure creates a tense rhythm of risk and reward, perfectly suited to the personalities of TGCF characters. Dialogue and voice lines reinforce the stakes, making every round feel like a narrative moment rather than just a mechanical exchange.

        <h2>Workflow Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          My initial concept leaned heavily into narrative storytelling, with elaborate cutscenes and branching dialogue. 
          However, during prototyping I realized that the heart of the experience lay in the bluffing mechanics themselves. 
          I shifted focus toward gameplay and dialogue integration, ensuring that character voices carried the narrative weight without slowing down the pace. 
          This pivot was challenging but ultimately optimized the design: players remain immersed in character interactions while still enjoying fast, strategic rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developing in Unreal Engine from scratch was a steep learning curve. I had to rebuild the gameflow and Blueprint systems multiple times, especially in regard to the NPC AI logic and dice spawning systems. 
          Mistakes — like overcomplicating the bidding system — forced me to simplify and streamline, which improved both usability and pacing. 
          These surprises reinforced the importance of iteration: listening to feedback and trimming excess features made the game stronger.

        <h2>Localization Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Localization was considered from the very beginning. Because TGCF has a passionate global audience, we wanted the game to resonate across English, Japanese, and Chinese players. 
          This shaped design decisions early on, including the title itself. Characters like Qi Rong demanded careful attention: his strong personality needed to be clear and consistent across all languages. 
          Familiarity with the book was vital — certain idioms or cultural references required adaptation rather than direct translation. 
          By prioritizing localization early, we avoided costly rewrites later and ensured that the game’s emotional tone carried across cultures.
