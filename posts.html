      <h1>What I did before attending the Institute</h1>

      <p>At seventeen, I found myself on a packed bus in Brest, France, talking to the other <em>stagiaires</em> about our career dreams. Most of them were aiming for international studies. When I said I wanted to be a game designer, I got a few surprised looks. For the first time, I began to question how my years of studying languages could fit into that plan.</p>

      <p>That question followed me for a while, until I volunteered at the Game Developers Conference. It was there I met professionals from across the industry, including someone in game localization who introduced me to an alum of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Learning about localization as the bridge between language and game development felt like everything suddenly clicked into place.</p>

      <p>During my time working on semester-long game projects, I gravitated toward production and project management, roles that taught me how to collaborate across disciplines. That experience led to a full-time position as a project coordinator at a data technology company. I honed my organizational and communication skills and explored industries like IT and healthcare, but I still missed working with languages and culture. That’s when localization began calling to me again.</p>

      <p>To build my skills, I started freelancing as a French and Korean translator, but I realized there was much more to learn about the technical side of localization. MIIS stood out as the perfect place to bridge that gap: a program combining technology, management, and language education with hands-on training in areas like vendor management and CAT tools. </p>

      <p>My ultimate goal is to work as a localization producer in the video game industry—ensuring players around the world can <strong>experience games in ways that feel natural and authentic in their own languages and cultures.</strong> I believe localization is just as essential to immersion as storytelling or gameplay. At MIIS, I hope to deepen my understanding of the field and contribute to communities like Women in Localization, all while developing projects that bring games closer to players everywhere.</p>

      <p>Looking back, I see a clear throughline from that bus ride in Brest to today: a love for language, culture, and play. Attending MIIS feels like the next step in uniting all of those passions into one meaningful career.</p>
