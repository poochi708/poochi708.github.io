        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello, I'm Shivani</h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">I love to make games and interactive experiences for players around the world!</h2>
        
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
        I began my journey as a <strong>game designer</strong>, captivated by the power of interactive storytelling and creating engaging experiences. Over time, I realized my true passion extended beyond design; I wanted to ensure that games could reach players around the world in ways that felt natural and authentic. This led me to pivot toward <strong>game production</strong> with a specialization in <strong>localization</strong>, combining my <strong>creative design background with project management and language expertise</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am a passionate game designer that strives to <strong>tell a story and create an engaging experience</strong> through a <strong>playcentric</strong> approach. I graduated from the University of Southern California's Interactive Media and Game Design program in 2023, the #1 ranked Game Design school in the world, and have learned so much via practical cross-functional collaboration in my journey. I'm currently studying Translation & Localization Management at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies!</p>
        
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In my free time, I love visual art, playing escape rooms and word/logic games, and learning languages. I speak <strong>5 languages</strong>: English, French, Tamil, Korean, and Japanese!</p>
        
        <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Favorite Media:</strong> OneShot (game), Invisible Monsters (book), Clue (movie), Psych and Hunter x Hunter (TV), NCT's whole discography (music) </p>
